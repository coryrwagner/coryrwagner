# Hi, I'm Cory ğŸ‘‹

I'm a pragmatic system architect and administrator with more than 25 years of experience working in IT managing and supporting everything from PCs to servers, storage, networking, and cloud. I ğŸ–¥ to design, build, and maintain data centers and production systems for our SaaS and managed-service customers, our internal operations, and our global R&D teams. ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the computer architecture and administration challenges that are stressing you.

GitHub helps me track open-source projects, submit changes to devopers, and manage my own projects.
